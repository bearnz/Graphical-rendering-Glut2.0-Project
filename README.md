# COSC363-Glut2.0-Project

This was a project assignment I completed in my final year of Computer Science at The University of Canterbury.
In this project, the idea was to render an interactive scene of a museum in OpenGL 2.0 using using Glut.

The CMakeFiles should allow you to run this program in Linux, running on windows requires a local installation of OpenGl 2.0 with Glut.
